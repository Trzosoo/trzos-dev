        Freelancing frontend remotely. Recently I have finished a project where
        I was responsible for moving old marketing site to a newer stack with
        new designs. The new stack contained Nuxt universal app, Tailwindcss,
        and StoryBlok as CMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that I was working for a semi-remote company in Warsaw building
        applications in React with Redux, then I got the SamKnows offer.

      <p>
        My adventure with frontend development actually started when I finished
        the Uni. I was making Wordpress sites for local companies in my area.

        I had this amazing opportunity to work with SamKnows and I couldn't say
        no. I joined the frontend team where I was responsible for maintaining
        the codebase and developing new features of samknows.one. After some
        time we've split into functional teams and I got into the marketing team
        where I had to build new samknows.com from ground up. Stack I choose was
        Vue.js with SSR Node app and prismic.io as CMS. Besides that I had to
        build sites for our government projects, like

      <p class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-600">OCTOBER 2016 - OCTOBER 2017</p>
      <p>
        I joined Bitbar to rewrite the UI of their main project and remove
        technical debt. It was written in CoffeeScript with jQuery and loading
        time was huge. I have joined a large team that was split into frontend,
        backend, QA, Dev OPS and OPS teams. My first achievement was speeding up
        the frontend build process. They used
        <a href="https://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a>
        before and build time was over 2min. By using
        <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a>
        with caching I managed to get build times under 100ms. Next I introduced
        linting, wchih caught over 40k linting errors over old codebase. Then we
        decided to move our app to
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>
        , because it was light, fast and we could go it gratually, view by view.
        After we've built the process to rewrite the app and rewrote main parts
        I moved on to pursure my dream of remote job.
