      <p>
        At Frontiers I joined a team to build an app for research paper reviewers. Tinder-style app where the user could volunteer to review a paper just with a swipe. We've built it with Nuxt 2 and moved it to Nuxt 3 later.
        I was responsible for the main functionality (swiping), application design, maintanance, mentoring, and creation of automated e2e tests.

      <p>
        I worked on a variety of web development projects using various technologies.
        In my first project, I built a site using Gatsby and Contentful as a CMS, which required a strong understanding of React and GraphQL.
        In my second project, I developed an app using Nuxt and Firebase, which involved implementing complex data models and integrating with third-party APIs.
        Lastly, I worked on several applications for Scandinavian energy companies using NextJS, where I was responsible for designing and implementing features,
        as well as ensuring the applications were scalable, maintainable, and performant. Throughout these projects,
        I demonstrated a deep understanding of web development best practices and was able to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products on time and within budget.

        I was responsible for maintaining and rebuilding existing software that generates landing pages for several markets based on JSON files from inhouse CMS.
        We were using React, Redux, Storybook to build and maintain a design system for the landing pages.
        I introduced Lerna to manage our monorepo more efficiently.

      <p>
        I joined LigoHub for a short contract to build https://lingohub.com/
        I used NuxtJS to statically generate the site, StoryBlok as CMS, and TailwindCSS for layouts.
        I was the only developer in the project working along with the designer.
        The main issue I had was to move over 300 blog posts from the old site to StoryBlok,
        I wrote a Node script to help me with that.

      <p>
        When I got this amazing opportunity to work with SamKnows and I couldn't
        say no. I joined the frontend team where I was responsible for
        maintaining the codebase and developing new features of samknows.one.
        After some time we've split into functional teams and I got into the
        marketing team where I had to build new samknows.com from ground up.
        Stack I choose was Vue.js with SSR Node app and prismic.io as CMS.
        Besides that I had to build sites for our government projects, like
        <a href="https://measuringbroadbandcanada.com/" target="_blank">

      <p class="text-sm font-bold text-gray-600">OCTOBER 2016 - OCTOBER 2017</p>
      <p>
        I joined Bitbar to rewrite the UI of their main project and remove
        technical debt. It was written in CoffeeScript with jQuery and loading
        time was huge. I have joined a large team that was split into frontend,
        backend, QA, Dev OPS and OPS teams. My first achievement was speeding up
        the frontend build process. They used
        <a href="https://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a>
        before and build time was over 2min. By using
        <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a>
        with caching I managed to get build times under 100ms. Next I introduced
        linting, which caught over 40k linting errors over old codebase. Then we
        decided to move our app to
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>
        , because it was light, fast and we could go it gradually, view by view.
        After we've built the process to rewrite the app and rewrote main parts
        I moved on to pursue my dream of remote job.
